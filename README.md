# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: start the program
### Step 2: assign values for the values x2,x1,y2,y1
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: print the distance format to display the answer with two decimal points 
### Step 5: end the program

### PROGRAM:
  ```

import math
x1=4
y1=2
x2=10
y2=6
a=(x2-x1)*(x2-x1)
b=(y2-y1)*(y2-y1)
c=a+b
sq=math.sqrt(c)
print("{:.2f}".format(sq))
```


### OUTPUT:
